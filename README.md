# Project Introduction

This is a Full Stack web app that was a project for school. It's a library management app and it's built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, Apollo, GraphQL and MongoDB.

I used zustand for the state management, instead of using the usual redux, for a change.

I deployed the app with heroku at: https://booklet-library.herokuapp.com/
